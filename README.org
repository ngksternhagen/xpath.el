xpath.el is a library for interacting with XML from emacs using the xpath specification
** TODO add link above.

* FAQ
** who is the official developer of this library?
Not really sure. I got this code from Emacswiki with the intention of putting it
on melpa. I contacted the person listed in the source as current maintainer,
Oliver Scholz <epameinondas@gmx.de> but so far I haven't heard anything back
about whether Oliver is still working on this project.
** is this repository going to continue development on xpath.el or just provide packaging?
This repository will definitely be used for packaging. It might be used for
further development (for example, the tests in this library do not use ert --
this would be an easy fix). If you are hoping for this library to become a 100%
compliant xpath tool, you might find yourself waiting a very long time.
